# Battleship + 1v1 Games (LAN, Terminal)

Two-player LAN games in your terminal. After both players connect, a lobby lets you pick a game together.

- Python 3.9+
- No external deps; just stdlib (`socket`) and ANSI escape codes

## Games available
- Battleship (classic 10x10)
- Snake (two-player, simultaneous turns)

If both players choose the same game in the lobby, that game starts. If they choose differently, a random choice decides.

## Install
```
python3 --version
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run (Terminal)
One of you will HOST (choose who), the other joins.

### Host (Player A)
1. Find your local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.23`). On macOS/Linux: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or `ifconfig`.
2. Start the host:
```
python -m battleship host --port 5000
```
3. Wait for your friend to connect, then pick a game in the lobby.

### Join (Player B)
```
python -m battleship join --host 192.168.1.23 --port 5000
```

- If your firewall prompts, allow incoming connections for Python.

## Controls
Battleship
- During placement: type coordinates like `A1`, `J10` and `R` for rotate (horizontal/vertical)
- During attack: type target tile `B7`, `E10`
- Use `q` to quit at any prompt

Snake
- Use WASD to steer. Press Enter to keep your previous direction. `q` to quit.

## Notes
- Must be on the same LAN/Wiâ€‘Fi. Internet play would require port forwarding or a relay server.
- Battleship ends when all ships of a player are sunk. Snake ends on collision; higher score wins, head-to-head or simultaneous crash is a draw.
