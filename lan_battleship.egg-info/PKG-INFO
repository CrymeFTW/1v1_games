# Battleship (LAN, Terminal)

Two-player Battleship playable over local network in your terminal. One player hosts; the other joins.

- Python 3.9+
- No external deps; just stdlib (`socket`, `threading`, `select`) and ANSI escape codes

## Features
- 10x10 classic board, ships: Carrier(5), Battleship(4), Cruiser(3), Submarine(3), Destroyer(2)
- Guided manual ship placement with orientation
- Clear boards using ASCII and colors
- Turn-based over TCP with simple, robust protocol
- Host/Join flow with reconnect-safe state sync

## Install
```
python3 --version
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
One of you will HOST (choose who), the other joins.

### Host (Player A)
1. Find your local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.23`). On macOS/Linux: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or `ifconfig`.
2. Start the host:
```
python -m battleship host --port 5000
```
3. Tell your friend your IP and the port.

### Join (Player B)
```
python -m battleship join --host 192.168.1.23 --port 5000
```

- If your firewall prompts, allow incoming connections for Python.

## Controls
- During placement: type coordinates like `A1`, `J10` and `R` for rotate (horizontal/vertical)
- During attack: type target tile `B7`, `E10`
- Use `q` to quit at any prompt

## Notes
- Must be on the same LAN/Wiâ€‘Fi. Internet play would require port forwarding or a relay server.
- The game ends when all ships of a player are sunk. A scoreboard is shown.
