# Versus - 1v1 LAN Games

Two-player LAN games with GUI lobby selection. After both players connect, choose from multiple games together.

- Python 3.9+
- Pygame for GUI interface

## Games available
- Battleship (classic 10x10)
- Snake (two-player, simultaneous turns)

If both players choose the same game in the lobby, that game starts. If they choose differently, a random choice decides.

## Install
```
python3 --version
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Run
One player hosts, the other joins.

### Host
1. Find your local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.23`). On macOS/Linux: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or `ifconfig`.
2. Start hosting:
```
versus host --bind 192.168.1.23 --port 5000
```
3. Wait for your friend to connect, then both pick a game in the lobby.

### Join
```
versus join --address 192.168.1.23 --port 5000
```

- If your firewall prompts, allow incoming connections for Python.

## Controls
Battleship
- During placement: type coordinates like `A1`, `J10` and `R` for rotate (horizontal/vertical)
- During attack: type target tile `B7`, `E10`
- Use `q` to quit at any prompt

Snake
- Use WASD to steer. Press Enter to keep your previous direction. `q` to quit.

## Notes
- Must be on the same LAN/Wiâ€‘Fi. Internet play would require port forwarding or a relay server.
- Battleship ends when all ships of a player are sunk. Snake ends on collision; higher score wins, head-to-head or simultaneous crash is a draw.
